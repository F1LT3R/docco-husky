A streamlined static site generator for project documentation based on [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/). "Husky" because it's bigger and more irregular than Docco, like [Husky](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-husky-size-in-clothing.htm) Jeans you would buy at Sears back in the day.

A fork of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/), intended to go beyond the appropriate scope of Docco itself. Forked because Docco itself is pretty simple and this is intended to diverge. The initial fork included merged pull requests from [nevir](https://github.com/nevir) and [jswartwood](https://github.com/jswartwood) for their work on supporting recursive directories and an improved "Jump To" menu.
