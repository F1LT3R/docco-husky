A streamlined project documentation static site generator based on [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/). Husky because it's bigger and more irregular than Docco, like [Husky](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-husky-size-in-clothing.htm) Jeans.

A fork of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/), intended to go beyond the appropriate scope of Docco itself. Forked because Docco itself is pretty simple and this is intended to diverge quite a big. The initial fork included merged pull requests from [nevir](https://github.com/nevir) and j[swartwood](https://github.com/jswartwood) for their work on supporting recursive directories and an improved "Jump To" menu.
